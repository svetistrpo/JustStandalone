#### Welcome to Just Standalone - Classic DayZ mixed with Adventures and continual changes!
##### Explore and shape your character
Journey onward to explore the unique adventures implemented and continually changed to survive and gear up as you grab rewards from a wide variety of missions and locations. Be it the classic guns and gear or the limited well thought of and balanced added gear.
High Tier will not be easily attainable nor in high quantity, but just in the right amount. You will think twice to shoot, as also the munitions are not available in vast abundance.
Find a punch card and locate the rumored Outpost (fast loot area which you will need to leave again after 6 minutes) on the map to possibly find the gear you need to survive this apocalypse.

##### Survive, Settle and make yourself unique
While you journey deeper into the map, locate building materials and start a base with the numerous storages you will find on your journeys to store all the required gear for your adventures and fights you might encounter to defend yourself and ward your territory.
Raid others with raidsaws and drivers to dominate your regions or form alliances to maintain yourself in a harsh world.


#### Highlights

Our “Just Standalone” modpack is a carefully selected collection of licensed mods, third-party mods approved for repacking and our own developments
Please note that all third-party mods included in our modpack are approved from their owners & creators for monetization, aligning with Bohemia’s monetization policy.
Here some information to the whole development of the server and its mods:


##### Groups, Territories with Basebuilding, Map Zones and Chat

You can form groups with up to 6 players. Claim territories & bases by building a flagpole (300m). The building regulations make it balanced and fair to everyone.
The map shows no building zones and the regulations clearly state where you can not build.
With the integrated chat you are able to communicate globally or with your group.

##### Auto-run & stamina

You can toggle auto-run with Numpad “+”, but be aware that continuous running will be draining your stamina and that you will never be able to swim faster.

Press “N” to use the “earplugs” to use the two stages to lower the game volume.

##### Enhancements and classical crafting

Lots of enhancements & functionalities are continuously being added to our mod while also enabling the classical crafting.

##### Vehicles

While there is no car damage, you can get unconscious with accidents i.e. and you will still be susceptible to bullets & explosions.

##### Versatile gear & slot use

You will notice that Ghillies, Teddybears, Smersh vests and a few other items will be equipable and usable in multiple gear slots.

Find unique military clothing or car’s that can help you in your survival by staying hidden or many other additions.
